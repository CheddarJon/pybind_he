### SANITY CHECK !

### SO ! You've gone through with the submodules , HElib and such ! Now you wanna try to run something ...? 

1. Go to the *pybind_he/script*

2. Run *run_example_HElib*

   ```bash
   $ cd script
   $ chmod u+x run_example_HElib.sh
   $ ./run_example_HElib.sh
   ```

3. This will first build in the *examples* directory, then run *bgv_matrix_op* which takes some time, keep that in mind...
